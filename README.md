# AICompany: Building an AI-Native Business

Welcome to the AICompany repository, where we're dedicated to assembling the resources and knowledge necessary to build an AI-native company inspired by the insights of Karim Lakhani and the transformative power of artificial intelligence (AI).

## Karim Lakhani's Vision of AI-Native Companies

Karim Lakhani, a professor at Harvard Business School, has extensively researched the impact of AI on business and competition. He posits that AI-native companies are fundamentally different from traditional businesses in their core operations, strategy, and potential for innovation. These companies are built around AI technologies from the ground up, leveraging data-driven insights to scale rapidly and adapt to changing market dynamics.

## Difference Between AI-Native and Traditional Companies

AI-native companies, also known as AI-first companies, differ from traditional businesses in several key aspects:

- **Core Integration of AI**: AI-native companies integrate AI into their core business processes, using it as a primary driver for decision-making and value creation.
- **Data-Centric Approach**: These companies treat data as a strategic asset, using it to gain insights, drive innovation, and maintain a competitive edge.
- **Scalability and Agility**: AI-native companies are designed to scale quickly and efficiently, thanks to their flexible, data-driven operational models.
- **Continuous Innovation**: They foster a culture of continuous learning and innovation, staying ahead of the curve in AI advancements.

In contrast, traditional businesses often adopt AI as an add-on to existing processes and may not fully leverage its transformative potential.

## Building an AI-Native Company from Scratch
