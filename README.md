# Introduction
## About the Project
Welcome to the AI Company repository, where we're dedicated to assembling the resources and knowledge necessary to build an AI-native company inspired by the insights of Karim Lakhani and the transformative power of artificial intelligence (AI).

## Project Goals
We aim to make AI accessible, understandable, and actionable, enabling even the smallest teams to leverage AI technologies to drive innovation, efficiency, and growth.

# Getting Started
## What is an AI-Native Company

Karim Lakhani, a professor at Harvard Business School, has extensively researched the impact of AI on business and competition. He posits that AI-native companies fundamentally differ from traditional businesses in their core operations, strategy, and potential for innovation. These companies are built around AI technologies from the ground up, leveraging data-driven insights to scale rapidly and adapt to changing market dynamics.

## Core Difference Between AI-Native and Traditional Companies

AI-native companies, also known as AI-first companies, differ from traditional businesses in several key aspects:

- **Core Integration of AI**: AI-native companies integrate AI into their core business processes, using it as a primary driver for decision-making and value creation.
 
- **Data-Centric Approach**: 
These companies treat data as a strategic asset, using it to gain insights, drive innovation, and maintain a competitive edge.

- **Scalability and Agility**: Thanks to their flexible, data-driven operational models, AI-native companies are designed to scale quickly and efficiently.

- **Continuous Innovation**: They foster a culture of continuous learning and innovation, staying ahead of the curve in AI advancements.

In contrast, traditional businesses often adopt AI as an add-on to existing processes and may not fully leverage its transformative potential.

# Agile Project Management
## Agile Project Management for building an AI Native company

Agile project management is a key approach for deploying AI in business. It enables organizations to adapt to the dynamic nature of AI initiatives and achieve faster time-to-market. The process includes a kickoff briefing, AI design sprint, proof of AI development, and AI application deployment in production.
